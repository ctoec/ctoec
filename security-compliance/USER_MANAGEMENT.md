# Access controls and user management 
### Site users
The CTOEC site uses WordPress's user roles and permission for access control and user management. The primary key for a user is a unique id that is not tied to the userâ€™s personally identifiable information. 

Site users may only be granted permission via an admin and only if approved by an official working for the State of Connecticut. Only users who have a State of Connecticut or business partner email address will be granted access to the system. A list of users and their roles are available to admins in the site's admin portal and also through a direct database connection or backup in case of a service outage. All user activity on the site is monitored and periodically reviewed including logins successes and failures. [See System Logging Section](./SYSTEM_LOGGING.md)

Active users on the system attend cybersecurity training yearly. 

### System developers

This project uses git for source control and github.com as a code storage solution. Any changes made to the code base are tagged with a specific developer's name and changes. In the event of an outage, copies of the code base distributed among its developers. 

Moreover, all developers use github.com accounts with 2-factor authentication to prevent unwanted access.

All system developers attend a yearly training module for cybersecurity safety and HIPAA compliance. [See training compliance](./training.test.js)
